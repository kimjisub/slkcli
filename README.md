# slk 💬

A macOS Slack CLI built for agent workflows.

`slk` reads the Slack desktop app's local session data, so you can work with Slack from the terminal without setting up OAuth apps, bot tokens, or manual cookie copying. It is designed for personal automation, AI agents, and fast terminal-native Slack workflows.

> Not affiliated with Slack. This tool uses your existing Slack desktop session and acts as your user account.
>
> Security / policy warning: `slk` does not use Slack's official OAuth flow. It reads locally available Slack session artifacts from the macOS desktop app and reuses them to act as the signed-in user. This is intended for personal automation on a machine you control.

## Why slk

- zero OAuth setup
- works with the Slack desktop app you already use
- built for CLI and agent workflows
- supports reading, searching, sending, reacting, drafts, pins, saved items, unread tracking, and workspace switching
- macOS-native auth flow using Keychain + local Slack storage

## Install

```bash
npm install -g slkcli
```

Or run it one-off:

```bash
npx slkcli auth
```

Requirements:
- macOS
- Slack desktop app installed and logged in
- Node.js 18+

### Local development install

```bash
cd /path/to/slkcli
npm link
```

To remove the global symlink later:

```bash
npm unlink -g slkcli
```

If you want a one-time install from the checked-out repo instead:

```bash
npm install -g .
```

| `--to YYYY-MM-DD` | Read messages until a date |
| `--all` | Include completed items in `slk saved` |
| `--no-emoji` | Disable emoji output |

## Channel, DM, and workspace resolution

You can target conversations by:
- channel name: `general`
- channel ID: `C08A8AQ2AFP`
- DM username: `@andrej`
- Slack user ID: `U07RQTFCLUC`
- workspace name/domain/team-id for `slk workspace use`

Examples:

```bash
slk read general
slk read C08A8AQ2AFP
slk read @andrej 100 --threads
slk send U07RQTFCLUC "hello"
slk send general "follow-up" --thread 1769753479.788949
slk workspace use alpaon
slk workspace use teamcandid
slk draft dm @andrej "hello"
slk message link general 1769753479.788949
```

## Threads and message references

Once you have a message timestamp, you can read the thread, reply to it, or inspect the exact message and nearby context.

```bash
slk thread general 1769753479.788949
slk reply general 1769753479.788949 "on it"
slk send general "same effect via send" --thread 1769753479.788949
slk message link general 1769753479.788949
slk message show general 1769753479.788949
slk message context general 1769753479.788949 2 2
```

## Multiple workspaces

If you're signed into multiple Slack workspaces in the desktop app, `slk` can enumerate and switch between them.

```bash
# show discovered workspaces
slk workspace list

# inspect the current workspace selection
slk workspace current

# switch by workspace name
slk workspace use alpaon

# switch by Slack domain or team id
slk workspace use teamcandid
slk workspace use T12345678
```

Legacy aliases `slk workspaces` and `slk switch ...` still work, but the `workspace ...` family is the canonical surface.

The selected workspace is then used for subsequent `slk` commands.

## How auth works

`slk` reuses the credentials already present in the Slack desktop app.

1. reads the encrypted `d` cookie from Slack's local cookie store
2. decrypts it using the `Slack Safe Storage` key from macOS Keychain
3. scans Slack local storage for `xoxc-` session tokens
4. validates candidate credentials against Slack
5. caches the working token locally for faster future runs

Token cache location:

```text
~/.local/slk/token-cache.json
```

Runtime coordination files:

```text
~/.local/slk/runtime/
```

If auth gets stuck or Slack rotated your session:

```bash
rm ~/.local/slk/token-cache.json
slk auth
```

## Security note

On first run, macOS may ask whether to allow access to `Slack Safe Storage`.

- `Allow` gives one-time access
- `Always Allow` is more convenient, but lowers the security boundary for any process running as your user
- `Deny` prevents `slk` from authenticating

If this machine is shared or tightly managed, prefer the more conservative option.

## Rate limiting and multi-process safety

`slk` coordinates Slack API requests across multiple local processes.

That means if several shells, agents, cron jobs, or bots invoke `slk` at the same time, they share one local request lane instead of all hitting Slack at once.

Behavior:
- requests are globally paced across local `slk` processes
- if one process gets HTTP `429`, the cooldown is written to shared runtime state
- other local `slk` processes honor that cooldown automatically

Useful environment variables:

```bash
SLK_MIN_REQUEST_INTERVAL_MS=1200
SLK_MAX_429_RETRIES=2
SLK_LOCK_STALE_MS=30000
SLK_LOCK_POLL_MS=100
SLK_DEBUG_RATE_LIMIT=1
```

## Agent-friendly workflows

`slk` is especially useful when an agent needs real Slack context.

Examples:
- `slk inbox unread` → find what needs attention now
- `slk read <channel> 100` → summarize decisions and action items
- `slk search "launch checklist"` → recover prior context
- `slk channel pins <channel>` → inspect canonical references
- `slk draft channel <channel> "..."` → prepare a message for human review
- `slk thread <channel> <ts>` / `slk reply <channel> <ts> "..."` → inspect and answer inside one thread
- `slk message link <channel> <ts>` / `slk message context <channel> <ts>` → recover one exact message plus its surrounding context
- `slk workspace list` / `slk workspace use ...` → move between locally signed-in workspaces without reconfiguring tokens
- multiple concurrent `slk` invocations → automatically share one paced local Slack request lane

## Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kimjisub/slkcli.git
cd slkcli
node bin/slk.js auth
npm link
npm test
```

## Live Slack integration tests

Default `npm test` stays safe for local/CI runs. It includes the live test file, but that file auto-skips unless you explicitly opt in.

### Read-only live verification

Use this when you want to verify auth, workspace resolution, unread inbox, and message-reference commands against the real Slack desktop session:

```bash
SLK_LIVE_TESTS=1 \
SLK_LIVE_CHANNEL=general \
SLK_LIVE_MESSAGE_TS=1769753479.788949 \
npm run test:live
```

This runs real end-to-end checks for:
- `slk auth`
- `slk workspace current`
- `slk inbox unread`
- `slk message link/show/context`

### Live write verification

To also verify real thread writes, opt in explicitly and provide a safe thread target:

```bash
SLK_LIVE_TESTS=1 \
SLK_LIVE_ALLOW_WRITE=1 \
SLK_LIVE_CHANNEL=general \
SLK_LIVE_MESSAGE_TS=1769753479.788949 \
SLK_LIVE_THREAD_TS=1769753479.788949 \
npm run test:live
```

This additionally runs real end-to-end checks for:
- `slk reply <channel> <thread_ts> <message>`
- `slk send <channel> <message> --thread <thread_ts>`

### Environment variables

- `SLK_LIVE_TESTS=1` — enable live Slack tests at all
- `SLK_LIVE_CHANNEL` — conversation used for message-reference and write tests
- `SLK_LIVE_MESSAGE_TS` — existing message timestamp for `message link/show/context`
- `SLK_LIVE_ALLOW_WRITE=1` — opt in to mutating live tests
- `SLK_LIVE_THREAD_TS` — existing thread target for `reply` / `send --thread`

The write tests intentionally require a second opt-in so `npm run test:live` does not post to Slack unless you explicitly allow it.

## Notes

- macOS only
- Slack desktop app required
- zero runtime dependencies beyond Node built-ins
- session-based, so actions happen as your user account
- `activity` and `unread` respect mute settings
- local runtime coordination files live under `~/.local/slk/runtime/`

## Inspiration

This project was lightly inspired by earlier Slack CLI work, especially [`therohitdas/slkcli`](https://github.com/therohitdas/slkcli), and is being adapted here for a more agent-centric workflow.
